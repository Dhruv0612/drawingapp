# Drawing App

### A Flutter application.

## Getting Started

### This App enables users to create simple drawings alongside which they can save those drawings. Options to rename, add another drawing drawing, and deletion have also been included. Paragraphs below explain the functioning off the app. <br/> Happy drawing!!


## Starting the drawing
### As you can see below, we are able to draw on the screen. <br/> Using the "floating action button" on the bottom left of the screen, we can clear the screen, and draw again.

## Saving the drawing
### Using the "floating action button" on the bottom right side of the screen, we can save the file. When we click the button, a dialogue box pops up, where we are required to enter the name of the file. After we click on save, we come to a view where all the files are visible.
